# Exploratory-Analysis-On-Play-Store-Apps

An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Google Play Store Apps and Reviews.

This project is about analyzing thousands of applications on Google Play Store and their corresponding reviews to gain valuable insights and relations between different features of each app in the dataset. Two datasets, namely Apps.csv and User Reviews.csv, have been used to understand how various features like App Price, App Size, Installs, App Category etc relate. Finally, the user reviews of each app are analyzed to find out the composition and Sentiment Polarity distributions.
